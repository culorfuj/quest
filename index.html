          <p><span style="color: #FFFF55">Tips:</span><br>1. Map and players in your game are important. Smaller maps generally better.<br>
            2. Learn chest routes. Here are some good maps for looting many chests: Alice, City, Greece, and Pixelville.<br>
            3. Choose a simple kit like Baker or Paladin.<br>4. Do not fight players who you cannot beat. Killing nons can give good stuff like Golden Apple or potions.<br>
            5. Blitz Star is very good, so try to be at mid to get it. If a player gets it then run. If it is a non, try to kill them before they use it.<br>
            6. In Deathmatch, try to clean rather than get cleaned.<br>
            7. Try to outsmart players who are better than you at pvp or cheating by using fall damage, Blitz Star, or cleaning.</p>
          <p><b><span style="color: #FFFF55">When to use Blitz Star</span></b><br>
            1. <b>Gremlin</b>: 1v1 Chasing a good player at edge of map. They will not have any armor/weapon besides what they find in Deathmatch chests or random piles.<br>
            2. <b>Assassin</b>: 1v1 against nons.<br>
            3. <b>Sweg Move</b> for fast wins. Good for lots of nons who are bad.<br>
            4. Few good people you know you cannot beat: <b>Vault</b> for a good weapon or star one of the two to force a 1v1 <b>(Nocturne or Robinhood)</b>.<br>
            5. <b>Robinhood, Ironman, or Gremlin</b> if you are feeling brave: Cheaters. <br>
            6. <b>Invokerer or Pickpocket</b>: If you want to have fun.<br>
            7. <b>Acid Rain</b>: Chasing someone on a specific map and feeling cool.<br>
            8. If you are playing a tanky kit or have good outer piece: <b>Supplies</b> can be fun since good armor, bow, or sword. <b>Vault</b> is usually safer.<br></p>
